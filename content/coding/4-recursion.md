3. WAF to compute nth Fibonacci number.
4. Tower of Hanoi - [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TowerofHanoi.html ] - Given a stack of n disks arranged from largest on the bottom to smallest on top placed on a rod, together with two empty rods, the towers of Hanoi puzzle asks for the minimum number of moves required to move the stack from one rod to another, where moves are allowed only if they place smaller disks on top of larger disks.
